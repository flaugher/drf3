# Django REST Framework v.3

These are examples from [Django REST framework 3](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

Use your "drf3" virtual environment, not django184.

#### Add Users and Groups

    # Create superuser, root or admin, your choice
    python manage.py createsuperuser --email admin@example.com --username admin

Log in to localhost:8000/admin and add them from there.

#### NOTE

I abandonned this effort to figure out how to use DRF3 to create, add, and delete lists via jQuery in my Django lists project because it looks too difficult.  This is the DRF example after I completed the initial "Quickstart" tutorial.  I never got past this point.
